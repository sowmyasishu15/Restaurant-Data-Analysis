**Bengaluru Restaurant Market Analysis**

This repository contains the code and findings from a data analysis project on the Zomato restaurant dataset for Bengaluru. The goal was to practice the end-to-end data analysis workflow: from data cleaning and preparation to analysis and visualization.

**Key Business Questions Answered**

What are the most common types of restaurants in Bengaluru?

Which are the top 10 busiest food hubs in the city based on the number of listings?

Is there a correlation between a location's popularity and the average rating of its restaurants?

**Key Insight & Visualization**

The analysis revealed that while some locations have a very high volume of restaurants, they don't necessarily have the highest average ratings. The bar chart below visualizes the average customer rating for each of the top 10 busiest locations, showing that areas like Koramangala not only have a high density of restaurants but also maintain a high standard of quality.
